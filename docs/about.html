			<h2>The Founders</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Sebastian Hunt</strong> and <strong>Dylan Richards Diaz</strong> are the visionary
				duo behind entire studios. Their partnership began during their time working together at
				Yeezy, where they honed their skills in minimalist design and learned the importance of
				balancing form with function.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="journey">
			<h2>The Journey</h2>
			<h3>From Tumblr to Yeezy</h3>
			<p>
				Before establishing entire studios, both founders cultivated their aesthetic sensibilities
				through digital platforms. Their early work on Tumblr showcased a keen eye for minimalist
				design and contemporary culture, which eventually led them to opportunities in high fashion.
			</p>

			<h3>The Yeezy Experience</h3>
			<p>
				Working under Kanye West's Yeezy brand was transformative for Hunt and Diaz. They gained
				invaluable experience in creating elevated basics, understanding fabric technology, and
				developing oversized silhouettes that have become synonymous with modern streetwear luxury.
			</p>

			<h3>Birth of entire studios</h3>
			<p>
				In 2020, armed with industry knowledge and a clear vision, they launched entire studios.
				Their goal was audacious yet simple: make luxury fashion accessible to everyone without
				compromising on quality or design integrity.
			</p>

			<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				"We believe that great design should be democratic," says Hunt. "Our pieces are crafted
				with the same attention to detail you'd find in luxury houses, but we've restructured
				our business model to make them attainable."
			</p>
			<p>
				The entire studios aesthetic is characterized by:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Clean Lines:</strong> Minimalist silhouettes that speak for themselves</li>
				<li><strong>Oversized Fits:</strong> Comfortable, contemporary proportions</li>
				<li><strong>Neutral Palettes:</strong> Timeless blacks, whites, and earth tones</li>
				<li><strong>Premium Materials:</strong> Carefully selected fabrics for durability and comfort</li>
				<li><strong>Functional Details:</strong> Thoughtful features that enhance wearability</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Celebrity Following</h2>
			<p>
				Despite their "accessible luxury" approach, entire studios has garnered a cult following
				among A-list celebrities and fashion influencers:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Bad Bunny:</strong> Frequently spotted in the signature PFD Puffer</li>
				<li><strong>Kim Kardashian:</strong> Featured entire studios in multiple social posts</li>
				<li><strong>Lewis Hamilton:</strong> Wore the brand to various F1 events</li>
				<li><strong>Kylie Jenner:</strong> Collaborated on exclusive pieces</li>
				<li><strong>Travis Scott:</strong> Regular supporter of the brand</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This organic celebrity endorsement proves that great design transcends price points—when
				given the choice, even those who can afford anything choose entire studios for its
				authentic aesthetic and quality.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="future-vision">
			<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
			<p>
				As entire studios continues to grow, Hunt and Diaz remain committed to their founding
				principles. Future plans include expanding their sustainable practices, introducing new
				seasonal collections, and exploring innovative fabrics—all while maintaining the
				accessibility that defines the brand.
			</p>
			<p>
				"We're not just building a brand," Diaz reflects. "We're proving that the fashion industry
				can change. Luxury doesn't have to be exclusive. Quality doesn't have to be expensive.
				And great design should be for everyone."
