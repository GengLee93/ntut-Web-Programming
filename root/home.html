			<h2>Making Luxury Accessible</h2>
			<p>
				Founded in 2020 by New Zealand designers Sebastian Hunt and Dylan Richards Diaz,
				<strong>entire studios</strong> emerged from a shared vision to democratize luxury fashion.
				Both alumni of Kanye West's Yeezy brand, the duo brings their expertise in minimalist
				design and premium craftsmanship to create pieces that bridge high fashion and accessibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our philosophy is simple: exceptional quality shouldn't require an exceptional price tag.
				Every garment is thoughtfully designed with clean lines, functional silhouettes, and
				timeless aesthetics that transcend seasonal trends.
